  i am horrible at interacting with people,
  for most of the time i am unable to function that well without my friend,
  if you see me alone i might appear extremely quiet. 
  i usually would tend to try avoid getting into groups or people due to how overwhelming it would get for for me, sorry
  <br>
  please let me know if i did something wrong, i am not usually aware whether if it's wrong or not

  please sign my atabook if you'd like B)
